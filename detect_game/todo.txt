//Create basic ball in environment  
//create dataset of images and asscoiated center locations 
//Add bb code 
//add noise to detections 
// Make the ball move in a circle
// Make a trail track thingy majig 
//Run base yolo model on sample real data 
Create custom python script that utilizes yolo inference 

Make realistic ball flight 
train yolo detector off dataset 
Plot yolo detections on game screen 
create kalman filter tracking prediction 
Plot smoothed tracking track thingy 

run simulation and plot detections 



FUTURE POSSIBLE GOALS 
use multiple balls and focus on the moving ball!!!!! 
-- apply optical flow to aid with filtering detections? 
-- add a batter object to predict strike zones 
-- create realistic pitch and test detector performance on the pitch 			
LONG TERM GOALS 
-- multistage/multitask network that feeds yolo detections of batter to action recognition network 
-- detect hits etc 



RELATION TO BIG STICK SOFTWARE 
-- need to track path of pitched ball (for correcting in windy conditions) 
-- need to find result position of pitch (for adjusting pitch position)
